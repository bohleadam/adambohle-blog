Hello reader. WElcome to my blog. I haven't had a blog for a number of years, and a great deal has changed since then. Those who know me may have come across [www.cloudyautomation.com](https://cloudyautomation.wordpress.com/) which was a blog I ran for a couple of years in 2013-14 mainly focused on, what was at the time, VMware Cloud Automation Center (vCAC), which would become vRealize Automation centre, a product which has undergone a great deal of change since VMware acquired the bulk of this product as part of the acquisition of DynamicOps in 2012 [Acquisition Details](https://www.vmware.com/uk/company/acquisitions/dynamicops.html).
