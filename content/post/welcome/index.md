Hello All. Welcome to my blog. I haven't kept a blog since 2014, and a great deal has changed since then. I moved across to Microsoft in 2016 to work as an Azure Cloud Solution Architect (CSA) in the One Commercial Partner Team there. I then returned to VMware on 2018 as one of the first EMEA VMware Cloud on AWS Architects and have since been involved in the incubation of a number of different VMware cloud offerings.

Those who know me may have come across [www.cloudyautomation.com](https://cloudyautomation.wordpress.com/) which was a blog I ran for a couple of years in 2013-14 mainly focused on, what was at the time, VMware Cloud Automation Center (vCAC), which would become [vRealize Automation](https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/vrealize-automation.html), a product which has undergone a great deal of change since VMware acquired the bulk of this product as part of the acquisition of DynamicOps in 2012 [Acquisition Details](https://www.vmware.com/uk/company/acquisitions/dynamicops.html).

Back then I was blogging about Extensibility in this solution, an area which suffered from a great deal of "Tribal Knowledge". In the CloudyAutomation blog I looked to demystify this topic and explain exactly how people could extend the capability of vCAC with workflows and PowerShell as a scripting tool.

It's a blog I have not looked at for a number of years and the content is now relegated to the technology history books, all of which is not relevant anymore to vRealize Automation Administrators. :smile: But at the time it certainly served it's purpose.

With this new blog I hope to create and share content related to my current role as a Multi-Cloud Architect at VMware. My previous blog was very useful for technologist trying to get to grips with vCAC, but the content had a short life span. With this blog I am hoping to provide a platform to talk about the stuff I am working on with the different VMware powered hyper-scale partners such as AWS, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Alibaba Cloud, the list goes on. This is a huge topic for VMware and a huge area of focus for VMware customers and partners, as well as the direct partners of the aforementioned hyper-scale cloud providers.

My plan here is to talk about what we are working on with these cloud providers and talk about what can be achieved from a technical implementation viewpoint by utilizing VMware technology across these public clouds, enabling continuity of operations, portability of workloads and the breaking down of barriers to where you run workloads, be it on-premise, or in the public cloud.

We will also talk about how VMware is **NOT** just providing a graveyard or a "nursing home" for heritage/legacy workloads, but enabling the ability to transform and modernize these applications on both vSphere and in combination with native public cloud services.
